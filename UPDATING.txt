to update simply update src data, commit to github, wait for a sec 
then open project in terminal and run npm deploy

WEBSITE

https://phillipmaire.github.io/portfolio/
/Users/phil/Dropbox/HIRES_LAB/GitHub/portfolio/

The above is working as expected with a few exception. 

The main branch is updated with all the files (as seen below)
.
├── .DS_Store
├── .all-contributorsrc
├── .env
├── .git
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc
├── Dockerfile
├── LICENSE
├── build
├── env.example
├── fetch.js
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
└── src


While the gh-pages branch updates automatically when you run 
npm run deploy
From that directory 
And this updates gh-pages branch with just the build file

—— 
Now why this doesn’t display all components correctly is beyond me. 

I can get everything to work correctly using npm start ONLY WHEN the file 
package.json
Is edited so that instead of 
"homepage": "https://phillipmaire.github.io/portfolio",
It is something random like this for example 
"homepage": “####”,
Or if I just left the original website from the original repo 


So something about this file and how it uses this variable kills the open source section.
Just a note, the data is being pulled correctly from my git since I can see the 200 output message and also when using npm start (with edit from above) I can see it update properly. 


cd /Users/phil/Dropbox/HIRES_LAB/GitHub/portfolio/
npm start
